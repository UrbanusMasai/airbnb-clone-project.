- **DevOps Engineer** → Manages CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and deployment environments to guarantee smooth and scalable releases.  
- **Project Manager** → Coordinates tasks, manages timelines, and ensures that the team follows agile practices and project objectives.  
- **QA Engineer (Tester)** → Validates features, writes test cases, and ensures the system is secure, bug-free, and performs well before release.  
- **Security Engineer** → Focuses on protecting user data, securing APIs, and implementing best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.  
---

##  Technology Stack  

This project leverages a modern backend-focused technology stack to build a scalable, secure, and efficient Airbnb-like booking platform. Each technology has a clear purpose in achieving project goals:  

- **Django** → A high-level Python web framework used to build backend logic, manage authentication, and expose RESTful/GraphQL APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL** → A powerful relational database for storing and managing structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and payments.  
- **GraphQL** → A flexible query language and runtime for APIs, enabling clients to request only the data they need, improving performance.  
- **Docker** → Provides containerization to ensure the app runs consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).  
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)** → Automates testing, deployment, and integration pipelines to ensure efficient and reliable releases.  
- **Nginx** → Used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to handle client requests efficiently and improve scalability.

###Database Design  

The database is designed to support core Airbnb-like functionalities, ensuring scalability, data integrity, and clear relationships between entities.  

### **Key Entities & Fields**  

1. **Users**  
   - `id` (Primary Key)  
   - `name`  
   - `email` (unique)  
   - `password_hash`  
   - `role` (guest, host, admin)  

2. **Properties**  
   - `id` (Primary Key)  
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
   - `title`  
   - `description`  
   - `location`  
   - `price_per_night`  

3. **Bookings**  
   - `id` (Primary Key)  
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
   - `start_date`  
   - `end_date`  
   - `status` (pending, confirmed, cancelled)  

4. **Reviews**  
   - `id` (Primary Key)  
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
   - `rating` (1–5)  
   - `comment`  

5. **Payments**  
   - `id` (Primary Key)  
   - `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)  
   - `amount`  
   - `payment_date`  
   - `status` (completed, pending, failed)  

### **Entity Relationships**  
- A **User** can list multiple **Properties**.  
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** is linked to a single **Property**.  
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews**, but only one review per booking/property.  
- A **Payment** is tied to a single **Booking**.

##  Feature Breakdown  

This Airbnb Clone project includes the following core features that simulate the functionality of a real-world booking platform:  

1. **User Management**  
   Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles. Authentication and authorization ensure role-based access for guests, hosts, and administrators.  

2. **Property Management**  
   Hosts can list properties with details such as title, description, location, price, and availability. Properties are searchable and filterable by location, price, and other attributes.  

3. **Booking System**  
   Guests can book properties for specific dates. The booking workflow includes availability checks, booking confirmation, and status management (pending, confirmed, or cancelled).  

4. **Review System**  
   Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked. Reviews provide credibility to hosts and improve decision-making for future guests.  

5. **Payment Integration**  
   Secure payment processing allows guests to pay for bookings. Payment records are tied to bookings and include status updates (completed, pending, failed).  

6. **Admin Dashboard**  
   Administrators can oversee users, properties, bookings, and payments. This ensures the platform runs smoothly and maintains security and trust across all interactions.

##  API Security  

Security is a critical part of building a trustworthy and scalable booking platform. The following measures will be implemented to ensure that data and transactions remain safe:  

1. **Authentication**  
   - Only registered users can access protected resources.  
   - We will implement **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or session-based authentication.  
   - Protects user accounts from unauthorized access.  

2. **Authorization**  
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) will determine what guests, hosts, and admins can do.  
   - Ensures users only perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., only hosts can manage property listings).  

3. **Rate Limiting**  
   - Prevents abuse of the API through excessive requests.  
   - Helps protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair resource usage.  

4. **Data Validation & Sanitization**  
   - All inputs will be validated and sanitized before processing.  
   - Prevents injection attacks such as SQL injection or XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).  

5. **Secure Payments**  
   - Payment data will be handled through secure third-party gateways.  
   - Ensures sensitive financial information is never exposed or stored insecurely.  

6. **Encryption**  
   - Sensitive data (like passwords) will be hashed and stored securely.  
   - All communication between clients and the server will use **HTTPS (TLS/SSL)**.  

**Why this matters**:  
- Protects user privacy and sensitive data (personal info, payment details).  
- Builds trust between users and the platform.  
- Ensures compliance with security best practices and industry standards.
